# react-a11y-calendar
An accessible, React-based calendar component

## Work in progress
This calendar aims at doing the following things:
- Provide an accessible calendar experience
- Be easy to put inside React projects
- Make customizing a calendar widget far less obnoxious
- Be lightweight

The ultimate goal is to have a React-based date-picker that doesn't suck. That's a tall order. Date-pickers are notoriously heavy, difficult to integrate into the look and feel of a project, and inaccessible. If this project becomes nothing more than a simple, lightweight calendar with great accessibility, then that would be a great accomplishment on its own.
